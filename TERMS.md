# Terms of Service for Hubs by Mozilla

Version 2.0, Effective July 23, 2018

[Hubs by Mozilla](https://hubs.mozilla.com) is a real-time communications platform for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Desktop, Laptop, Mobile, or however else you browse the internet. These Terms of Service explain your rights and responsibilities when you use Hubs.

### 1. Privacy Policy
The Hubs [Privacy Notice](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/blob/master/PRIVACY.md) explains what information we collect when you use Hubs by Mozilla and how that information is handled and shared.

### 2. Communications and Content
Hubs allows users to send information (such as audio, video, images, and 3D models) to other users. By using Hubs, you agree to give Mozilla all rights necessary to operate Hubs by Mozilla. This includes, but is not limited to, a license and permission to transmit and display the information you send through Hubs and to gather and share information as described in the [Privacy Notice](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/blob/master/PRIVACY.md) for Hubs by Mozilla. 

When you submit information to Hubs, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display that information, audio, video, images, or 3D models. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with the information or data you submit, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to the data you submit.

You also represent and warrant that you have the authority to grant Mozilla all rights and permissions necessary for the operation of Hubs by Mozilla. To learn more about how Hubs operates, you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs).

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Hubs that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Mozilla may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

You are solely responsible for the information you send using Hubs and the consequences of sending that information. 

### 3. Conditions of Use 
By using Mozilla Hubs, you agree that your use will comply with Mozilla’s [Conditions of Use](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/acceptable-use/). Mozilla reserves the right to remove any content, suspend any users, and shut down any room it reasonably believes has violated these conditions.

Please also be aware of [Mozilla’s Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), which address participation in Mozilla communities. 

### 4. Mozilla's Rights
Mozilla does not grant you any intellectual property rights in Hubs unless these Terms specifically say otherwise. For example, these Terms do not provide the right to use any of Mozilla’s copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

Mozilla distributes the Hubs software under an open source license. To learn more, you can read the [license itself](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/blob/master/LICENSE) or read the [FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/).

### 5. Services Interruption; Term; Termination
We are continuing to develop Hubs. As a result, we plan to upgrade and change Hubs over time. To do this, we might have to temporarily suspend Hubs and it is not always possible for us to give notice. You will not be entitled to claim expenses or damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of Hubs.

These Terms apply to your use of Hubs and will continue to apply until ended by either you or upon notice from Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by discontinuing your use of Hubs.

We may cut off your access to Hubs, either temporarily or permanently at any time for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for Mozilla; or (iii) providing and operating Hubs is no longer commercially viable. If possible, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you through Hubs.

In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use Hubs, except that the sections with the following titles shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability and Miscellaneous.

### 6. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, and its respective parent and affiliate companies, contractors, contributors, licensors, partners, directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of Hubs. This includes, but is not limited to, claims and expenses from any content you transmit using Hubs.

### 7. Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING.

YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED.
THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### 8. Modifications to These Terms
Mozilla may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts, forums, or in the particular service itself, in this case: Hubs by Mozilla.

Your continued use of Hubs after we post the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of this page.

### 9. Miscellaneous
These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Mozilla concerning Hubs. The laws of the state of California, U.S.A (excluding its conflict of law provisions) govern this agreement.

If any portion of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions remain in full force and effect. If there is a conflict or ambiguity between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the English language version applies.
